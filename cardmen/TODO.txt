artcle writing system thing

angular 2 frontend, spa
 - view mode, edit mode of article, search mode (default) last few articles
 - webpack to build client
 - call web api to do stuff

web api
 - article controller
 - setup nservicebus, rabbitmq stuff in startup, (move to some extension methods, shared?)
 - Use Request<> for blocking calls else just send/broadcast? (the event one) where necessary

storage service
 - net core app, use same shared setup above?
 - mongo interactions, save articles, etc
 - subscribe to new article/update events at some known endpoint

search service
 - net core app, use shared setup above?
 - elastic search interactions, index articles etc
 - subscribe to new article/update events
 - handle search based commands

messages
 - separate lib
 - all the different command / event types
 - potentially the common setup stuff for nservice bus, maybe even the DI net core extension methods

docker
 - the web app container
 - rabbit mq container
 - storage service container
 - search service container
 - mongo db container
 - elastic serach container
 - will need to check stuff like persistance to file, existing images may already have this covered with volumes??
 - use docker compose file to set all images up at same time, on one docker host
